# Portfolio-Website-2017

This is another attempt at building a personal portfolio website. However, this is the one that will finally be finished (the others are 'done', but I've learned more to deem them obsolete).

Using the slider page setup, I'm making a 5 slide page, that when each navbar item is clicked, it will scroll to that slide. With this, I'm using the usual HTML, CSS, and JS, but I'm also using Bootstrap as well as jQuery. PHP will be used for the contact page.

Written within sublime text 3, I'm hoping to have this done by the end of September 2017, as soon as I have more projects to place within.

I plan to update regularly, as this will be my main personal website.
